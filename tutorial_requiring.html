	<h1>Requiring the GALua module</h1>
	
	<p>
	To use the GALua module, begin by requiring it in your script.  Like so...
	</p>
	
<pre>
  -- Grab the GALua API table.
  local galua_api = require "galua"</pre>
	
	<p>
	Of course, this will fail if the GALua.dll file has not been installed in a place where Lua can find it.
	It is up to you to make sure that it is installed correctly, or that you tell Lua where it can find the module.
	Place the GALua.dll with your other Lua modules, or adjust your LUA_CPATH environment variable to point to the
	location where you have placed GALua.dll.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Once you have access to the API table, almost everything you'd ever want to do with the module can be accessed
	through this table.  (Everything else is accessible as a meta-method of the multi-vector data-type.  More on that later!)
	To see what's available, you might simply do a dump of the API table.
	</p>
	
<pre>
  for key, value in pairs( galua_api ) do
    if type( value ) == "function" then
      print( key )
    end
  end</pre>
	
	<p>
	As of this writing, this prints the following text to your console.  Your results, of course, may be in a different order!
	</p>
	
<pre>
  to_number
  def_bar
  version
  to_latex_string
  mag
  copy
  add
  def_sig
  reverse
  from_string
  op
  dif
  sum
  left_inverse
  right_inverse
  inverse
  ip
  gp_inv
  gp
  set_grade_part
  to_string
  get_grade_part
  coef
  neg
  sub
  def_basis
  from_number</pre>
	
	<p>
	Many of these functions perform mathematical operations, but a program that uses these exclusively would get too wordy and
	combersome to write.  Such operations, therefore, have been provided as meta-methods that overload
	some of Lua's built-in binary and unary operators.  More on this is given in a subsequent tutorial.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Among the functions printed above you'll find the <code>version</code> function.  Taking no arguments,
	this function simply returns the version number of the GALua module you're using.  At the time of
	this writing, it would return 1.0.  After determining which version of the module you're using, you
	might have your script check to make sure that this is the version it was written for before moving on.  I don't
	have any plans to maintain backwards compatibility, but I also don't expect the API to change much at all,
	so there's not really much to worry about here.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Well, this is just great!  Now that you're up and running with the module, we can get started using it.
	On to the next tutorial!
