	<h1>Requiring the GALua module</h1>
	
	<p>
	Before using the GALua module, you have to gain access to it.  The following code snippet illustrates this.
	</p>
	
<pre>
  -- Grab the GALua API table.
  local galua_api = require "galua"</pre>
	
	<p>
	Of course, this will fail if the GALua.dll file has not been installed in a place where Lua can find it.
	It is up to you to make sure that it is installed correctly, or that you tell Lua where it can find the module.
	Once you have access to the API table, almost everything you'd ever want to do with the module can be accessed
	through this table.  (Everything else is accessible as a meta-method of the multi-vector data-type.  More on that later!)
	To what's available, you might simply do a dump of the API table.
	</p>
	
<pre>
  for key, value in pairs( galua_api ) do
    print( key .. " -> " .. tostring( value ) )
  end</pre>
	
	<p>
	This prints the following to the screen.
	</p>
	
<pre>
  Put output here...</pre>
	
	<p>
	Many of these functions perform mathematical operations, but a program that uses these exclusively would get too wordy and
	combersome to write.  Such operations, therefore, have been provided as meta-methods that overload
	some of Lua's built-in binary and unary operators.  More on this is given in a later tutorial.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Among the functions printed above you'll find the <code>version</code> function.  Taking no arguments,
	this function simply returns the version number of the GALua module you're using.  At the time of
	this writing, it would return 1.0.
