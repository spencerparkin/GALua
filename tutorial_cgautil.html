	<h1>Utilizing the CGA companion module</h1>
	
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	
	<p>The CGA companion module comes along with and is dependent upon the GALua module.
	It provides a number of Lua classes, each representative of a geometric primitive of
	the conformal geometric algebra (CGA) for 3-dimensional space.
	These geometries are listed in the following table, each accompanied with a loose description.</p>
	
	<table border="1">
	<tr><td>Geometry</td><td>Description</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Point</td><td>The basic element making up all geometries.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Sphere</td><td>A set of all points equidistance to a given point.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Plane</td><td>A set of coplanar points.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Line</td><td>A set of colinear points.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Point-Pair</td><td>A set of colinear points equidistant to a given point.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Circle</td><td>A set of coplanar points equidistant to a given point.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Flat-Point</td><td>Another point representation of CGA.</td></tr>
	</table>
	
	<p>
	The flat-point has some interesting properties in CGA, one of which is that it is
	the only geometries of CGA that, when expressed in direct form, cannot be written
	as the outer product of (round) points.
	In any case case, this page is not an attempt to teach CGA.  For that, I refer the
	reader to the following list of sources.

	<p>
	An instance of one of the classes of the CGAUtil module is an object representative of
	a CGA geometry.  Being a Lua table, it's entries give the defining characteristics
	of that geometry.  As we know from CGA, however, it is the blades of the Minkownski
	geometric algebra that are either dually or directly representative of a given piece
	of geometry.  (On the other hand, a given blade simultaneously represents two
	different geometries; one dually, the other directly.  Which we care about is simply
	a matter of interpretation -- a choice we are free to make.)  Where the use of the
	CGAUtil module comes into play, therefore, is in its ability to convert between such
	blades and objects (class instances).  The conversion from object to blade is known
	as composition, while the conversion from blade to object is known as decomposition.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	To free this tutorial from the great many mathematical details chosen by the CGAUtil module,
	such details are given at length in the following document, which has been prepared
	specifically for the CGAUtil module.

	<p>
	A great deal of thought and effort has gone into making sure that this math is correct.
	Any update to the math performed in the CGAUtil module will also be reflected in a
	change to this document.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	All of this said, we're ready to show how one may go about using the CGAUtil module.
	We will do so by simply giving a number of examples that illustrate the usage of
	various features of the module.
