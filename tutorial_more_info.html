	<h1>More than you wanted to know</h1>
	
	<p>
	In this tutorial we cover features of the GALua module that the user might take advantage of, but of which
	are not necessary for a complete utilization of the GALua module as a GA calculation engine.  The support
	for these extra features takes less priority over the primary mission of the GALua module, and therefore,
	one should not take any of what is about to be covered in this tutorial for granted.
