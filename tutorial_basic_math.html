	<h1>Basic math operations</h1>
	
	<p>
	Once we have a geometric algebra defined, we're ready to start making GA calculations.
	One way to get started is by creating multivectors for each basis vector we registered with the module.
	This can be accomplisehd as follows.
	</p>

<pre class="example">
local e1 = galua_api( "e1" )
local e2 = galua_api( "e2" )
local e3 = galua_api( "e3" )
local no = galua_api( "no" )
local ni = galua_api( "ni" )
</pre>

	<p>
	Here we see that the function call syntax has been implemented for the API table so that
	we may call it with a string value.  Each of the strings given above correspond to
	one of the basis vectors we registered with the module earlier.  (Here we are assuming
	that we have defined the conformal geometric algebra of 3-dimensional space.)
	</p>
	
	<p>
	We're now ready to get down to business!  Consider the following sequence of script code.
	</p>

<pre class="example">
local pos = 3*e1 + 2*e2 - e3
local radius = 5.5
local sphere = no + pos + 0.5*( pos*pos - radius*radius )*ni
pos = 2*e2
local norm = e2 + 2*e3
norm = norm / #norm
local plane = norm + ( norm .. pos )*ni
local circle = sphere ^ norm
</pre>
  
	<p>
	This example calculates a dual circle that is the intersection of a dual sphere and a dual plane.
	Convenience methods for composing and decomposing such geometries are available in a companion module named CGAUtil.
	More on that is given in a later tutorial.  For now, the above script code serves to illustrate what kinds
	of math operations we can perform and how to to perform them.  Much of it is fairly intuitive and straight-forward,
	but we'll continue now to explain in detail what math operations are available and what they do.
	</p>
  
	<p>
	The binary operations supported by the GALua module are summarized in the following table.
	</p>
	
	<table border="1">
	<tr><td>Binary Operation</td><td>Overloaded Lua Operator</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Addition</td><td>"<code>+</code>"</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Subtraction</td><td>"<code>-</code>"</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Geometric Product</td><td>"<code>*</code>","<code>/</code>"</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Outer Product</td><td>"<code>^</code>"</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Inner Product</td><td>"<code>.</code>", "<code>..</code>", "<code>[]</code>"</td></tr>
	</table>
	
	<p>
	As you can see, there are quite a few options available for the inner product.  Some effort has been made
	to allow the use of the indexing operator ("<code>.</code>"), but its use is not recommended, because it requires the GALua
	module to synthesize Lua's scoping algorithm.  Though its use may make your scripts easier to read, refraining
	from its use gives you a greater guarentee of correctness.  The concationation operator ("<code>..</code>") is therefore the
	preferred method while the indexing operator ("<code>[]</code>") is also supported for those that are assuming a left or
	perhaps right contraction.  Of course, Lua syntax always requires that the indexing operator ("<code>[]</code>") appear
	on the right, so this may not be entirely useful.  Never-the-less, it's there.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The multilication operator ("<code>*</code>") implements the geometric product.  The division operator ("<code>/</code>") is
	simply short-hand for multiplying its left operand by the inverse of its right operand.  If the
	right operand is a singular multivector, a Lua exception will be thrown, and your program will
	halt at this location.  A way to attempt the calculation of multivector inverses without incurring
	such a fatal error will be given shortly.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The idea of coercion is supported by all of the binary operations given in the table above.
	This is important to realize, and means that the GALua module, if not given a multivector value
	for both arguments in a call to one of its binary operations, will try to coerce any non-multivector value
	into an appropriate corresponding multivector value.  This is mainly useful for Lua number values as can be seen
	in the formulation of the position of the dual sphere given above, and in the subsequent calculations made.
	Any strings that are encountered will be treated in the same way that the function call syntax overload of the API
	table treats such strings.  That is, the following two lines of Lua are the same.
	</p>
	
<pre class="example">
bivec = -3 * e1 ^ "e2"
bivec = -3 * e1 ^ galua_api( "e2" )
</pre>
	
	<p>
	Now lets talk about the unary operators.  These are summarized in the following table.
	</p>
	
	<table border="1">
	<tr><td>Unary Operation</td><td>Overloaded Lua Operator</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Negate</td><td>"<code>-</code>"</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Magnitude</td><td>"<code>#</code>"</td></tr>
	</table>
	
	<p>
	Of course, this is the not the full list of unary operations supported by GALua, just the
	full list of such operations that are implemented as overloads of existing Lua unary operators.
	The rest of the unary operations are given as meta-methods you can call on a multivector value.
	</p>
	
	<table border="1">
	<tr><td>Unary Operation</td><td>Meta-method</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Reverse</td><td>"<code>:reverse()</code>"</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Inverse</td><td>"<code>:inverse()</code>"</td></tr>
	</table>
	
	<p>
	Like any binary operation, every unary operator returns a new multivector value, leaving the multivector variable untouched.
	That is, it does not alter the multivector value referenced by the multivector variable it is operating upon.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	If the <code>inverse</code> meta-method is called on a singular multivector, the result
	will be zero.  If you are ever unsure about the invertibility of a given multivector value,
	it is best to call this instead of performing a division operation.  By default, the <code>:inverse()</code>
	meta-method calculates a right-inverse.  That is, the multivector that, if multiplied by the given
	multivector on the right in the geometric product, gives the multiplicative identity.  Use the
	<code>:left_inverse()</code> and <code>:right_inverse()</code> meta-methods to be explicit about
	which inverse you desire to calculate.  (At the time of this writing, I'm not sure if multivectors
	generally commute in the geometric product with their inverses.  For now, left and right inverse operations
	are supported under an absense of making such an assumption.)
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Now that we're capable of doing some basic math, we're ready to cover our printing options.
