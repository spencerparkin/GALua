	<h1>Printing multi-vectors</h1>
	
	<p>
	Printing a multi-vector is super easy.  One way to do it is as follows.
	</p>

<pre>
  local multivec = 2 - 7*e1^e3 + 2*e2^e1 + e2 - e1^e2^e3
  print( "multivec = " .. tostring( multivec ) )</pre>

	<p>
	Printing the multi-vectors of GALua is simply a matter of converting them to a string, and
	then printing the string.  In general, there are two routines supported by the GALua module
	that provide conversion between string values and multi-vector values.
	</p>

<pre>
  local multivec = galua_api.from_string( "2 - 7*e1^e3 + 2*e2^e1 + e2 - e1^e2^e3" )
  local multivec_str = galua_api.to_string( multivec )
  print( "multivec = " .. multivec_str )</pre>

	<p>
	These functions are designed to be inverses of one another.  That is, strings created by
	<code>galua_api.to_string(...)</code> should be consumable by <code>galua_api.from_string(...)</code>.
	As of this writing, there are some known bugs, but it works for the most part.  (I know that's not
	very reassuring.  The bugs will get fixed.)
	</p>
	
	<p>
	You must
	be aware that the <code>galua_api.from_string(...)</code> function does not take a string
	interpreted as Lua code!  Just what language is being interpreted by the <code>galua_api.from_string(...)</code>
	function is covered in an up-coming tutorial.  For now, it is safest to only convert
	strings that are the basis vectors you have defined for your geometric algebra.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	You should also be aware that the functionality provided by <code>galua_api.to_string(...)</code>
	and <code>galua_api.from_string(...)</code> functions is the same functionality being tapped
	by GALua's overload of the built-in <code>tostring(...)</code> function, as well as our function
	call syntax overload of the GALua API table.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Though currently experimental, you may want to be aware of a latex option for printing.
	By calling <code>galua_api.to_latex_string(...)</code>, you can generate a string for the
	given multi-vector value that may be compiled by latex for type-setting purposes.
	This feature is mainly useful in conjunction with the limited support for symbolic manipulation
	in the underlying GA computation engine of GALua.  The coverage of such support is beyond
	the scope of these tutorials.  However, if you would like to type-set any numerical multi-vector
	value, (as apposed to an abstract variable multi-vector value), you may use <code>galua_api.to_latex_string(...)</code> to do so.
