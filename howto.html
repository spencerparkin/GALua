	<h1>How to use the GALua module</h1>
	
	<p>
	The GALua module is easy to use.  There are three basic steps to using the module.
	First, you must, of course, require the module in your Lua script.  Second, define
	the geometric algebra you would like to work in.  And lastly, simply make use of the
	module functions.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Requiring the module</h3>
	
	<p>
	Before using the module, you have to gain access to it.  The following code snippet illustrates this.
	</p>
	
	<code>
	-- Grab the GALua API table.<br>
	local galua_api = require "galua"
	</code>
	
	<p>
	Of course, this will fail if the GALua.dll file has not been installed in a place where Lua can find it.
	It is up to you to make sure that it is installed correctly, or that you tell Lua where it can find the module.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Defining the GA</h3>
	
	<p>
	To define a geometric algebra, we give GALua a set of basis vectors and then define the behavior
	of those basis vectors in the inner product.
	</p>
	
	<code>
	galua_api.def_basis{ "e1", "e2", "e3" }<br>
	galua_api.
	</code>
