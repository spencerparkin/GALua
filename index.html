	<h1>The GALua Module</h1>
	
	Welcome!  You've just happened upon the GALua project page!  Enjoy your stay!
	
	<H2><A NAME="what">What is GALua?</A></H2>
	
	<p>
	GALua is a Lua module written in C++ adding support for GA (geometric algebra).
	The goal of the GALua module is to endow the Lua programming language with
	support for GA data-types (i.e. multi-vectors.)
	</p>
	
	<H2><A NAME="how">How do I get GALua?</A></H2>
	
	<p>
	The current, official distribution of GALua is <a href="GALua-win32-v1.0.zip">GALua-win32-v1.0.zip</a>.
	It is compatible with Lua 5.2.  As of this writing, there is is not yet a zipped archive
	for Linux or other platforms, but Linux is on the list of things to do.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Alternatively, you can grab the entire project tree and build GALua yourself.
	To do that, simply clone the GALua reposirty by issuing the following command.
	</p>
<pre>
 $ git clone https://github.com/spencerparkin/GALua.git</pre>
 
	<p>
	You'll need to know that GALua depends upon a statically linked library known as
	<a href="https://github.com/spencerparkin/CalcLib">CalcLib</a> which
	provides the GA calculation engine.  It is kept in a seperate repository, because
	other projects, (such as <a href="http://spencerparkin.github.com/GAVisTool/">GAVisTool</a>),
	depend upon it too.
	</p>
	
	<H2><A NAME="how">How do I learn GALua?</A></H2>
	
	<p>
	Documentation on the module is provided <a href="howto.html">here</a>.
	As of this writing, GALua is on its first major release (v1.0).
