	<h1>GALua -- A Lua module providing Geometric Algebra (GA) Support</h1>
	
	<p>
	The goal of the GALua module is to endow the Lua programming language with
	support of GA data types (i.e. multi-vectors.)  At the time of this writing,
	the module is experimental and admittedly slow, but it works.  You can obtain
	a copy of the module as a ZIP archive or tar-ball, along with the entire project
	source.
	</p>
	
	<h3><a href="https://github.com/spencerparkin/GALua/zipball/master">Download GALua as a .zip file</a></h3>
	<h3><a href="https://github.com/spencerparkin/GALua/tarball/master">Download GALua as a tar.gz file</a></h3>

	<p>
	It is important to note that this project is still under development and has
	not yet reached what I would consider a beta version.  Once its reached beta,
	I will put out some documentation on how to use the module.
