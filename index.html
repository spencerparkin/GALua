	<h1>The GALua Module</h1>
	
	Welcome!  You've just happened upon the GALua project page!  Enjoy your stay!
	
	<H2><A NAME="what">What is GALua?</A></H2>
	
	<p>
	GALua is a Lua module written in C++ adding support for GA (geometric algebra).
	The goal of the GALua module is to endow the Lua programming language with
	support for GA data-types (i.e. multi-vectors.)
	</p>
	
	<H2><A NAME="how">How do I get GALua?</A></H2>
	
	<p>
	The current, officient distribution of GALua is <a href="GALua-win32-v1.0.zip">GALua-win32-v1.0.zip</a>.
	It is compatible with Lua 5.2.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	If you are interested in seeing the entire project tree, you can obtain
	a copy of the module as a ZIP archive or tar-ball, along with the entire project
	source.  GALua depends upon a statically linked library known as
	<a href="https://github.com/spencerparkin/CalcLib">CalcLib</a> which
	provides the GA calculation engine.
	The <a href="http://spencerparkin.github.com/GAVisTool/">GAVisTool</a>
	program is also based upon this library.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Following is a list of links giving you the entire module project source which you can use to build the DLL
	yourself for your platform.  As of this writing, there are no project files or makefiles for platforms other than Win32.
