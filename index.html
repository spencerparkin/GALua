<H2><A NAME="what">What is GALua?</A></H2>
	
<p>
GALua is a Lua module written in C++ adding support for GA (geometric algebra).
The goal of the GALua module is to endow the Lua programming language with
support for GA data-types (i.e. multivectors.)
</p>
	
<H2><A NAME="how">How do I get GALua?</A></H2>

<p>
The current, official distribution of GALua is <a href="GALua-win32-v1.0.zip">GALua-win32-v1.0.zip</a>.
It is compatible with Lua 5.2.  As of this writing, there is not yet a zipped archive
for Linux or other platforms, but Linux is on the list of things to do.
</p>

<p>
Alternatively, you can grab the entire project tree and build GALua yourself.
To do that, simply clone the GALua repository by issuing the following command.
</p>
	
<pre class="example">
 $ git clone https://github.com/spencerparkin/GALua.git
</pre>
 
<p>
You'll need to know that GALua depends upon a statically linked library known as
<a href="https://github.com/spencerparkin/CalcLib">CalcLib</a> which
provides the GA calculation engine.  It is kept in a seperate repository, because
other projects, (such as <a href="http://spencerparkin.github.com/GAVisTool/">GAVisTool</a>),
depend upon it too.
</p>

<p>
You'll then need <a href="http://jamplus.org/projects/jamplus/wiki">JamPlus</a> installed
to build the project using its existing Jamfiles.  Once installed, issue the following
command in the GALua project root directory.
</p>

<pre class="example">
 $ jam -sCONFIG=release -sPLATFORM=win32 GALua
</pre>

<p>
Of course, replace the platform argument with the appropriate option for your platform.
</p>

<H2><A NAME="how">How do I learn GALua?</A></H2>
	
<p>
Documentation on the module is provided <a href="howto.html">here</a>.
As of this writing, GALua is on its first major release (v1.0).
