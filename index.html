<H2><A NAME="what">What is GALua?</A></H2>
	
<p>
GALua is a Lua module written in C++ adding support for GA (geometric algebra).
The goal of the GALua module is to endow the Lua programming language with
support for GA data-types (i.e. multivectors.)
</p>
	
<H2><A NAME="how">How do I get GALua?</A></H2>

<p>
The current, official distribution of GALua is <a href="GALua-win32-v1.0.zip">GALua-win32-v1.0.zip</a>.
It is compatible with Lua 5.2.  As of this writing, there is not yet a zipped archive
for Linux or other platforms, but Linux is on the list of things to do.
</p>

<p>
Alternatively, you can grab the entire project tree and build GALua yourself.
To do that, simply clone the GALua repository by issuing the following command.
</p>
	
<pre class="example">
 $ git clone https://github.com/spencerparkin/GALua.git
</pre>
 
<p>
You'll need to know that GALua depends upon a statically linked library known as
<a href="https://github.com/spencerparkin/CalcLib">CalcLib</a> which
provides the GA calculation engine.  It is kept in a seperate repository, because
other projects, (such as <a href="http://spencerparkin.github.com/GAVisTool/">GAVisTool</a>),
depend upon it too.
</p>

<p>
You'll then need <a href="http://jamplus.org/projects/jamplus/wiki">JamPlus</a> installed
to build the project using its existing Jamfiles.  Once installed, issue the following
command in the GALua project root directory.
</p>

<pre class="example">
 $ jam -sCONFIG=release -sPLATFORM=win32 GALuaDLL
</pre>

<p>
Of course, replace the platform argument with the appropriate option for your platform.
Once it's built, you can run the <code>env.bat</code> batch file to setup some environment
variables making the newly built Lua interpreter visible to the shell, and making the
newly built GALua shared library visible to the Lua interpreter.  To verify that things
are working correctly, you might try changing to the test-scripts directory and running
a few of the tests.
</p>

<H2><A NAME="how">How do I learn GALua?</A></H2>
	
<p>
Documentation on the module is provided <a href="howto.html">here</a>.  In fact,
the rest of this site is dedicated to documenting GALua.
</p>

<p>
At the time of this writing, I support GALua as if it had a user-base; although,
admittedly, I am the only user.  For any serious applications requiring GA support,
GALua may not be well-enough along, or fast enough, but for basic matters, I believe
that it could very well be useful to someone.  In any case, and if nothing else,
GALua has served and continues to serve as an excellent exercise for me in learning how to write Lua modules.
