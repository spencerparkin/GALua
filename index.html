	<h1>GALua (v1.0) -- A <a href="http://www.lua.org/">Lua</a> module providing support for <a href="http://geocalc.clas.asu.edu/html/Intro.html">Geometric Algebra</a>.</h1>
	
	<p>
	The goal of the GALua module is to endow the Lua programming language with
	support for GA data-types (i.e. multi-vectors.)  At the time of this writing,
	the module is experimental and admittedly slow, but it works.  You can obtain
	a copy of the module as a ZIP archive or tar-ball, along with the entire project
	source.  GALua depends upon a statically linked library known as
	<a href="https://github.com/spencerparkin/CalcLib">CalcLib</a> which
	provides the GA calculation engine.
	The <a href="http://spencerparkin.github.com/GAVisTool/">GAVisTool</a>
	program is also based upon this library.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The current, officient distribution of GALua is <a href="GALua-win32-v1.0.rar">GALua-win32-v1.0.rar</a>.
	It is compatible with Lua 5.2.
