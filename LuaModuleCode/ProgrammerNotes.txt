PROGRAMMER NOTES
================

A note about calling conventions is in order.  For any function named "l_*",
I have adopted a convention that such functions always reference their arguments
relative to the top of the stack, and that they remove those arguments before
returning, replacing them with any results, the number of which should be returned
by the C-function.  This allows the function to be easily called internally by
any other function, or directly by Lua.  This convention was adopted later on as
I learned more about writing a Lua module, so if this convention is not followed
somewhere, it is my fault.

THINGS TODO
===========

-- Fix pathing issues.
-- Learn about Lua packages so that we can put all our modules in a package?
-- Create GAUtil.lua companion module to take care of GA definition scripts.
-- Create CGAUtil.lua companion module to take care of CGA composition/decomposition.
